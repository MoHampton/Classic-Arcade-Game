## :video_game: How to Play 
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
Once the player collides with an enemy (The JavaScript Bug :bug:), the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
